Here are some ideas to get you started:

My name is Ashley Lawless and I am a first year at SAIT. I am currently taking Interactive Design with a main focus in Web Design. I might end up changing my mind about my focus but regardless im still interested in learning as much as I can!

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting comfortable with my classes. Most of the classes I am taking are completely new to me. I am discoering where I am comfortable and where I can thrive.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about code as well as different forms of media. Code is something new to me so learning about front and back end code is really interesting. I am also testing out illustrator and forms of lighting and camera angles in my digital media class. All of which is completely new to me and very interesting to learn!
