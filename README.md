## Hi there 👋

<!--
**ashlaw05/ashlaw05** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

Here are some ideas to get you started:

My name is Ashley Lawless and I am a first year at SAIT. I am currently taking Interactive Design with a main focus in Web Design. I might end up changing my mind about my focus but regardless im still interested in learning as much as I can!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on getting comfortable with my classes. Most of the classes I am taking are completely new to me. I am discoering where I am comfortable and where I can thrive.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about code as well as different forms of media. Code is something new to me so learning about front and back end code is really interesting. I am also testing out illustrator and forms of lighting and camera angles in my digital media class. All of which is completely new to me and very interesting to learn!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with HTML coding and the basic steps on how to customize a website. As I have mentioned before, coding is very new to me and it is something I am not as comfortable with. It would be nice to talk to my peers and see if I can understand it a bit more. 
- 💬 Ask me about the PSA I made in digital media!
